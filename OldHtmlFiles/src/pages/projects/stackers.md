introduction: 'Single-use plastics are a major environmental problem, and baby care packaging is a major culprit. 
Most plastics take hundreds of years to decompose, even though they are only used for a few minutes, days, or weeks.
 While plastic recycling programs exist, they often do not accept mixed-material packaging, which is commonly used in baby care products.'
