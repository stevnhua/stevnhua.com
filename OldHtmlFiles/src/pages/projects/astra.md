introduction: "ASTRA is a compact arcade console themed with space. It is designed to create an engaging interaction 
between the user and the machine, triggering various mechanisms and providing a playful, joyful, whimsical,
 and devious experience. The concept that drove the design of ASTRA was to create a machine that gamifies space.
 The final design of ASTRA consists of the following components: A simple projector with an LCD screen and lens to magnify the image.
A holographic glass where the image is projected to create a holographic effect.
An ultrasonic sensor as a trigger. When a user is detected, a curtain is lifted by 
a servo motor and an LED strip is lit up, all connected by an Arduino UNO."

myRole: "A circular hologram can be viewed in the center of the machine.
     The projection is created by a Raspberry Pi (Retropie) running a space arcade game.
      The user can then play the game with an Xbox controller connected to the Raspberry Pi remotely.
       After 2 minutes, the curtain closes (end of the game). ASTRA is encased in a two-story cylindrical black acrylic structure 
    that can be opened and closed at the top by an iris linkage mechanism."
